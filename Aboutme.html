                                    Hi, I’m Jithukrishnan, but most people just call me Jithu. I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast with a background in software development and a passion for solving problems that matter. I started my journey in tech as a developer, but over time I found myself drawn to the world of security—where curiosity, constant learning, and creative thinking all come together.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I recently completed my master’s in Cybersecurity at Pace University in New York, and I’ve had the chance to work across global teams from India to the U.S., in roles that blend detection engineering, DevSecOps, and threat research. I enjoy getting hands-on with SIEM tuning, reverse engineering, and building out secure CI/CD workflows, but I’m equally interested in the human side of security—like mentoring, collaboration, and contributing to community events.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Outside of tech, I love teaching myself new things. I’ve taught myself piano, picked up four languages, and have a soft spot for CTFs, conferences, and building little projects that let me experiment with new tools and techniques. I believe in staying curious, growing through failure, and always showing up ready to learn.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If you’re passionate about solving tough security problems or just want to talk shop, feel free to connect. I’m always up for a good conversation.
                                </p>
